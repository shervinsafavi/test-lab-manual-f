    "section": "2.3 How we share things (and send them to Gavin)",
    "text": "2.3 How we share things (and send them to Gavin)\nWe think it is useful to have standard ways of sharing things. These don‚Äôt always have to be followed but are a useful guide and will make things easier. When sending material to someone, always make sure to describe what you are sending and try to make it as easy as possible for them to help you.\nTaking a project-based approach to organizing your work makes it easier to share and solicit feedback from others, as things tend to be self-contained. Try to keep only 1 working instance of material, and use some form of version control to facilitate this (see recommendations in Wilson et. al paper linked above).\nProject management tools in Github are a good way to record and document questions on analyses. Use ‚ÄòIssues‚Äô on github repositories for project-related tasks and problems. Alternatively, make use of a GoogleDoc for each project to record this history, much like you would a lab notebook.\nCode: can be shared via Github repositories, or via a dedicated Google Drive folder. For specific questions on problems, please try to create a minimal reproducible example. Ensure that others can run and interact with the material being shared.\nWriting: Preferably via GoogleDoc, R Markdown, or Overleaf, but MS Word documents can also be shared. Google docs are particularly useful for collaborative writing, and have the advantage of there only ever being one version (as opposed to files that are sent around via email). Word documents should always have your last name as the first part of the file name (e.g.¬†please no ‚Äúmythesis.doc‚Äù).\nWe also share our institutional knowledge through our lab-chat github ‚Äòissues‚Äô repository. This is a community-driven troubleshooting resource, please contribute!\nWe maintain a lab Google Drive folder for lab publications, presentations, photos, CVs, etc. Please make use of these so that others in the lab can make fair use of our work."

    "section": "",
    "text": "We approach our science with a common denominator of kindness. As part of our core lab culture, we:\n\nAsk for help, and share our learning\nMake ourselves available\nCome prepared and engage\nCelebrate accomplishments (ours & those of others)\nSustain a positive, safe learning environment\nHave an interdisciplinary (open) mindset\nAre mindful of our own biases\nPlan with intention, and follow through\nFoster inclusivity within our group and greater community\nPromote and sustain healthy work-life integration\nPractice radical candor\nAcknowledge and give credit to other lab member‚Äôs work\n\nThough we do not expect incoming members to memorize everything, we do expect members to be aware of the group‚Äôs values.\nAsk for help, and share your learning: We are all learners, and most of our learning is done from each other. It is inefficient to struggle through problems alone. Ask for and give assistance with appropriate cognizance of the value of your time and the time of the person you are asking. You are not the first or last person to encounter a problem. When you identify a problem add an issue to the lab issues repository, and update it with solutions when it is resolved. Also consider writing a tutorial/blog post for inclusion in our lab‚Äôs shared resources, and share with the larger community by tweeting, leading and sharing at a lab meeting, or running a workshop (Quantfish woRkshop group, SouthCoast useR group, etc).\nMake yourself available: Be responsive to communication, and make time for things that address longer term goals, even when busy. For example, do not skip on things like attending seminars just because you have a big deadline looming (see note below on planning and organization). Note that being available does not mean that you are available 24/7 - this is not expected. Because as a group we value the role of collaboration and interaction in improving our work, it is expected that you be available in the lab/office during normal business hours for some time during the week (see section on attendance expectations).\nCome prepared and be engaged: Value your time. Be present during lab and individual meetings, and come to your work ready to do your work. Contribute and participate in planning and lab discussions. When it is your turn to run a meeting, come with an agenda and be prepared with questions. Aim to view meetings as events that contribute to your work and productivity, rather than taking away from them.\nCelebrate accomplishments (yours & others): You and your colleagues work hard. Things don‚Äôt always go exactly as you plan. Be supportive and proud of yourself and your peers when you accomplish things. We are not competing with each other - someone else‚Äôs success does not mean your failure. Share your accomplishments with others!\nSustain a positive, safe learning environment: Everyone learns something for the first time at some time, and people learn in different ways. Expressing that you don‚Äôt know something is OK, and we understand that this can make someone feel vulnerable. We strive to maintain a culture that allows for and encourages this vulnerability. Community members should not be disparaged for not knowing things, and in addition, should not be disparaged for knowing things or wanting to learn.\nHave an interdisciplinary (open) mindset: We apply our work at the science-policy interface. This means we work on problems that span multiple disciplines. Co-creation of knowledge requires transdisciplinary approaches that can result in solutions that would not be possible with siloing. You will be collaborating with others who have different types of expertise, values, and terminology. Trust the expertise of others and actively seek feedback recognizing the importance of specialization.\nBe mindful and aware of your own biases: We all have biases that are inherent and can not be removed, but we can still work on both being less biased, and more aware of bias in ourselves and others. Periodically check in on your biases.\nPlan with intention, and follow through: Be organized and adaptable. Things don‚Äôt always go as planned and that‚Äôs OK. Planning can help you adapt when they don‚Äôt (see Come Prepared). Find a program/project management approach that works for you (see ‚ÄúHow we work‚Äù); being organized can reduce stress immensely and help you progress with your goals.\nFoster inclusivity within our group and greater community: Part of our lab culture is that we are good citizens of our community, we take on leadership roles within SMAST and the University, we are supportive of others in our community during their milestones, we actively participate in SMAST events (e.g.¬†the IMS graduate research symposium) and perform outreach. Work with Gavin when crafting your individual mentoring/development plans (see Chapter on Onboarding) to identify what you want to aim your efforts at.\nPromote and sustain healthy work-life integration: Our scientific research is not the only important thing in our lives, and publishing research is not the only mechanism by which to provide science and support our communities. We recognize the importance of our other commitments in keeping us healthy (mentally and physically) and bring our whole selves to our efforts. Try not to normalize overwork or being busy as achievement or status.\nPractice radical candor: We care personally while also challenging directly. Be honest when communicating, accept critical (but kind) feedback, and give the same to others. View relationships within the group as collaborative rather than evaluative. Don‚Äôt take constructive criticism personally.\nAcknowledge and give credit: Working as part of a team, we will often (always?) be building on work done by others, receive assistance with work (see ‚ÄúAsk for help‚Äù), and using others‚Äô words, code, content. Include acknowledgement and give credit for those contributions, in all forms of communication. We share content and code within the group with this expectation. One easy approach is to include hyperlinks to the work of others or their social media in your work. This also helps to amplify their voice and work as well as yours."

If you do not wish to contact Dr.¬†Fay, please contact Department Chair Dr.¬†Steve Cadrin scadrin@umassd.edu and/or SMAST Assistant Dean Mike Marino mmarino@umassd.edu. If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as we can.\nLab members who believe they have been subjected to any kind of discrimination that conflicts with the University of Massachusetts‚Äô policies and/or the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts‚Äô should seek assistance from a supervisor or an HR representative. Information about the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth‚Äôs Equal Opportunity and Anti-Harassment policies, complaint procedures and form.\nConfidentiality: Please remember that by way of his position at the university, Dr.¬†Fay is a mandated reporter under Title IX. This means that he is not allowed to keep matters falling under Title IX confidential, and is required to disclose these incidents to the administration. You are welcome to discuss matters with Dr.¬†Fay, but please keep this in mind when doing so. Gavin will do his best to remind you of his responsibilities at the start of conversations anticipated to relate to these topics. If you would prefer to discuss incidents of harassment that fall under Title IX with a confidential source, you can contact David Gomes, UMass Dartmouth Director of Diversity and Inclusion.\nThis code of conduct applies to Fay lab spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of the Fay lab or another member of the SMAST community outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by Fay lab members seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from the Fay lab based on their past behavior, including behavior outside Fay lab spaces and behavior towards people who are not in the Fay lab. The University Counseling Center provides a range of services to help students develop improved coping skills to address emotional, interpersonal and academic concerns.\nTo protect our team members from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.\nThe above caveats noted, we will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse when possible. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we‚Äôve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of the Fay lab members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.\n\n\n4.2.2 Consequences\nParticipants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.\nIf a participant engages in harassing behavior, Dr.¬†Fay may take any action they deem appropriate, which includes referral to the Department Chair and Dean‚Äôs Office under the SMAST policy, and also including expulsion from all Fay lab spaces.\n\n\n4.2.3 Additional resources\nOther University of Massachusetts Board of Trustees and University documents:\n\nPolicy Against Intolerance\nPrinciples of Employee Conduct\nResolution in Support of Pluralism\nNon-Discrimination and Harassment Policy\nStatement of Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity\nStatement on Cultural Diversity and Inclusion\nStatement on Gender Discrimination\nBully, Harassment and Violence\nStudent Conduct Policies and Procedures\nSexual Harassment Policy\nTitle IX and Sexual Assault/Harassment"

    "text": "6.1 Working hours\nGavin generally does not hold people to working a fixed schedule, or to be in the office for a certain schedule. As adults, we should all set the working schedule that is the right fit for us, and it is likely that what this ‚Äòfit‚Äô is will change over the course of the time you are in the lab. Depending on the nature of your appointment, there may be specific hours that will need to be worked and you should work with your main collaborator to outline these.\nGavin generally does not work evenings or on weekends, and does not expect that people in the lab are available at these times. Lab members should also not expect others to be available during these times.\nGraduate students are generally funded on annual research assistantship (RA) stipends. The RA contracts state that this stipend is for 20 hrs of work per week during the academic year and 40 hrs per week during summer to support full time study in the academic program. Most usually, students on RAships are being paid from a research grant where the focus of the grant is the topic the student is working on for their thesis research, so there is overlap here. We believe that training to do the research is part of the job, so this would include courses and additional time to read/learn methods, software too. Some people find that counting ‚Äòbillable hours‚Äô is productive for them as it helps them keep accountable to themselves. Others do not find this method useful. Regularly assess what works best for you.\nFull time is enough, and we do not expect team members to work nights and weekends, though do not enforce a particular working hours schedule because students should feel flexible enough to create a work schedule that works for them. Lab members should not expect others to be available during evenings and weekends. There is value to interacting with others as part of your work, and we do expect you will be available during normal working hours for at least some of the time during the week. We also recognize that there will occasionally be times where there is a need to work more to meet a deadline, but this should be the exception - an expectation of overwork is not to be normalized."

This means you need to stay on top of program and university deadlines, requirements, etc. See Chapter @ref(umassd-resources) & Chapter @ref(smast-resources) for links to resources.\nBefore registering for each semester, you are required to meet with your advisor (Gavin) to review your tracking sheet (SMAST academic milestone document) and discuss plans for the forthcoming semester (classes, activities, etc.).\nCourse of study: Work with Gavin when crafting and revisiting your individual mentoring plans to identify classes that you will take during your academic program. Look beyond those offered at SMAST to include elsewhere at UMassD, the UMass system, and also at other institutions (consider the value of a semester exchange). A list of classes that lab members have taken, and suggested course of study schedule for Fay lab grad students can be found in Chapter @ref(courses).\nWe schedule regular individual meetings with Gavin throughout the year. At a minimum during the semester these will take place every two weeks, although there may be times when more regular meetings are needed. Meetings are a chance for you to get focused time with Gavin to discuss and work on your research. Thus they are your time, not Gavin‚Äôs. Come with an agenda with a list of things that you want to accomplish and work on during that time.\nWe share our research at local, national, and international meetings, and publish our findings in the scientific literature. Gavin strives to provide financial support for grad students to attend at least one major conference per year. You should expect to give a presentation (a poster or a talk) on your work at these.\n\n6.6.1 Funding\nGavin does not typically accept students into the lab without being able to guarantee at least 2 years of full funding. Students are encouraged to seek and apply for extramural funding to support their work. This includes scholarships and fellowships to pay for salary, but also smaller grants for travel, workshop attendance, or research costs. There are many opportunities out there, particularly for students. Some resources are outlined in Chapter @ref(funding)."

Gavin encourages students to think about dissertation chapters as publishable units. In the disseration, these 4 chapters will be accompanied by a general Introduction, and a concluding Synthesis chapter that ties the work presented in the dissertation together under the overarching research theme and goals.\nMilestones\n\n10.2.1 Pre-proposal (or ‚ÄúPreposal‚Äù, copyright M. Winton)\nPhD students in the Fay lab prepare a pre-proposal during their first year to outline the overall goals and themes of the dissertation research topic, and identify the individual research chapter topic questions. The pre-proposal serves as a guiding document and conversation starter for your initial committee meeting. Scope and plans for the thesis research will be developed through your meetings with Gavin and with the project team (for students whose work is being funded by a research grant). Your pre-proposal should contain a literature review, identification of research questions and potential chapter units, an overview of the methods that will be used to address the research questions, proposed course of study (coursework, etc.), and relevance/significance of the research. Aim for the pre-proposal to be about 5 pages of text. A 2-page precis version is useful when initially talking with committee members. While not a formal requirement for the IMS program, a pre-proposal serves to clarify student interests and goals for the degree for both the student and the thesis committee, and serves as a blueprint for building out the preliminary work and the dissertation proposal (indeed you may likely re-use some of the text later).\n\n\n10.2.2 Dissertation Committee\nYour PhD thesis committee serves as your guidance team during your research, and should be viewed as colleagues and collaborators. There is a required minimum for interaction with the committee, but you should add to this. After you have formed the committee, it is advisable to hold a committee meeting at least once a year, but it is encouraged to continuingly interact with committee members.\nWhile building your pre-proposal, discuss with Gavin who should be on the committee. For PhD committees, four members is the usual size, though often students will have a fifth member. Generally in our program a committee will be made up of your advisor (Gavin), two additional UMassD faculty members, and 1-2 external members (e.g.¬†agency collaborators on the project funding the research, e.g.¬†collaborators at NOAA NMFS). Aim to hold your first committee meeting no later than during the 3rd semester of your program. See the official university guidelines for more specifics [link here].\n[something on what is expected at committee meetings, e.g.¬†presentation]\n\n\n10.2.3 Comprehensive Exams\nAs detailed in the IMS policy, PhD students undertake a two-part comprehensive examination, a 2-day written exam, and a public presentation and defense of the proposal. The written exam is taken once students have completed their coursework requirements (say after the 4th or before/during the 5th semester). Questions on the written exam include both open and closed book sections and will cover coursework and questions related to your field and dissertation topics. The proposal defense is usually scheduled the semester following successful completion of the written exam. Full requirement details for the exams are in the IMS policy. The comprehensive exam will be planned in coordination with Gavin, and the written exam requires 1 month preparation time (1 month of full-time work). See guidance below. [Written exam format & guidance] [Proposal defense format & guidance]\n\n\n10.2.4 Dissertation Proposal\nA proposal describing the research that will comprise the dissertation is a required, formal part of the academic program. Proposals should describe the goals and themes of the research to be conducted, and its context within current state of knowledge. The proposal should outline the research questions that each chapter will address, and give a description of the methods that will be used in each. The proposal serves as a guiding document for the remainder of your program and is the document that you and your committee will use to agree on the scope of work to be completed to fulfill the degree requirements. Your thesis proposal should contain a literature review, identification of research questions, an overview of the methods that will be used for each of these, and description of expected results and relevance/significance of the research. Aim for the proposal to be about 15 pages of text. Detail of planning for each chapter will not be as comprehensive (it is expected that later chapters may not be as fleshed out), but the proposal should provide enough detail of what the student will do for the committee to evaluate whether the scope of work is sufficient (and likely make recommendations for reducing or refining this). It is common for students to have completed or be close to having completed work for at least one of the chapters by the time of defending the proposal.\nUltimately, the proposal serves to clarify and outline expectations for the degree for both the student and the thesis committee, and serves as a blueprint for building out the thesis itself (indeed you will re-use some of the text later).\nPhD Thesis: [guidance on thesis structure to come]\nRemember, not everything will go to plan and your interests and findings may change.

    "text": "12.5 Collaborative software\nFor writing, we collaborate using GoogleDocs. For code and analyses we encourage the use of version control (see Wilson et al.¬†paper for what this could look like), stepping toward the use of git and github for sharing code and analyses. We believe there are many advantages of using these tools to help simplify workflows and shift cognitive load to the science being done rather than on organization and bookkeeping (which computers are good at). Recognizing that these tools represent a learning curve, we provide training in their use, and also encourage alternatives for sharing and documenting work. For example, code and analyses may also be shared among collaborators using a Google Drive folder."

Thus it is critical to ensure your data and work are backed up regularly. You may have personal backup solutions (e.g.¬†through Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.) but the lab has dedicated storage space on a university server that is backed up in multiple locations. Your data should be backed up on here. For information on logging on and accessing this, see information provided on a GitHub issue"

    "text": "12.7 Introductory R learning resources\nWelcome to R! There are so many learning resources out there it can feel a little overwhelming in terms of what to choose! To get you set up and started, Happy Git and Github for the useR is a great resource, and is created by the same authors as the now-legendary stat545.com course. Their resources are extremely comprehensive and they have a fantastic Intro R course, especially for those who will be using R for doing statistics.\nRight now, we REALLY like this short intro course by @juliesquid & @allisonhorst. They teach a lot of the workflow and tools around using R right from the get go, which we think is more helpful than knowing how to do all the things. The (excellent) materials are thoughtfully put together, link to a ton of other great resources, and just like the online #rstats community in general, are super supportive of new learners.\nWe also really like:\n\nTeacup Giraffes R and statistics materials from Desir√©e De Leon and Hasse Walum.\n\nData Science in a Box course by Mine √áetinkaya-Rundel, and\nAdventures in R by Kelly Bodwin.\n\nIf you want a book to work from/through, R for Data Science is highly recommended. (book is free online)\nThe R Studio Education team have assembled a phenomenal array of courses, tutorials, and other materials for learning R, and for many types of data analyses and modeling using R. These are top notch and so thoughtfully put together. There is something for learners at all levels.\nA plug for the online R community. Follow the hashtag #rstats, & also check out accounts @RLadiesGlobal & @R4dsCommunity. The weekly #TidyTuesday social coding project is also a great way to practice your growing R skills. Have fun!\nThe R4dsCommunity Slack is a briliant resource for getting help to your R questions and finding tutorials. They also hold online Office Hours where you can get help with R from a real human.\nThe RStudio Community is a great go-to.\nLearn R from within R with interactive sessions using swirlstats.com.\nThe carpentries R lessons are also a fab resource."
